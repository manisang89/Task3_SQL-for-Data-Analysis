# SQL Queries for E-Commerce Database

## Task Overview
In this repository, I am practicing SQL queries on an e-commerce database. The objective is to become proficient in writing SQL queries for common operations, including `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, subqueries, and using aggregate functions.

### Database Setup:
The e-commerce database includes the following tables:

1. **Customers**: Information about customers.
2. **Products**: Product details like price, name, category.
3. **Orders**: Contains orders made by customers.
4. **Order_Items**: Details about products within each order.

## Files Included:
- **`create_and_insert_db.sql`**: This file contains the SQL commands to create the database schema and insert sample data into the tables.
- **`queries.sql`**: A file containing all the SQL queries you can run on the database.
- **`queries.pdf`**: This file contains the expected output of all the queries.
